# 🧠 The Mathematics Behind
The simulation relies on two core mathematical principles:
Exponential Production Cost: As content quality approaches 100%, the time required to produce it grows exponentially. This is managed by the Complexity Factor.
Sigmoid Viral Probability: Low-quality content has a near-zero chance of going viral. Success probability increases rapidly after a certain quality threshold before hitting diminishing returns.

### 🛠 Features
* **Interactive Simulation:** Adjust timeframes and complexity in real-time using a modern GUI.
* **Dynamic Visualization:** Real-time graphing of success curves and production volume.
* **Optimal Point Detection:** Automatically calculates the exact quality level that maximizes your viral potential.
* **Modern UI:** Built with `CustomTkinter` for a sleek, dark-themed desktop experience.

# 💻 Installation
